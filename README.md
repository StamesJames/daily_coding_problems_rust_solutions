# daily_coding_problems_rust_solutions
My solutions to the exercises from the book "Daily Coding Problems" writen in rust

I use these exercises for one to learn the rust programming language and also to better understand wich lowlevel operations are needed for variouse tasks. Because of that I often don't use the most ergonomic way to programm some problem but the way that I think gives me the most insight about how it functions.
For example I deliberetly chose not to use Copy in some cases. I used Clone instead, to better see where implicite clone calls would happen.
